        <p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
        <p>As the Sofia 3GR units are Intel units running x86 Android and the Rockchip PX5 units are ARM64 units running ARM64(/ARM8/ARM7/ARM) Android, we can't use the same software. <strong>So read the correct instruction for your Sofia unit or PX5 unit</strong>.<br><i>(At this moment Joying sells the Intel SC9853i units. These units require a totally different way of rooting. See the XDA forum thread <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android-auto/android-head-units/howto-root-joying-sc9853i-head-unit-t3915530">HowTo: Root Joying SC9853i Head Unit</a> and download the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=4741406&d=1555084756">developer.zip</a>. It contains everyhing you need, including an extensive Readme.)</i></p>
            
        <p>On Android 6.0.1 and Android 8.0.0 rooting requires 2 steps:
            <ul>
                <li>First you need to "enable adb over wifi" which must be done on your Sofia 3GR or PX5 head unit, using my apk.</li>
                <li>After that you need to do the rooting itself from your pc/laptop.</li>
            </ul>
            On Android 5.1.1 (only relevant for the Sofia unit) you only need to do the rooting part on the laptop/pc.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If your wireless network has a 2.4GHz and a 5GHz network, make sure  your pc/laptop is on the 2.4GHz. Your unit only works on 2.4GHz and from experience I know that when your pc/laptop is on 5GHz, you often can't connect, or you get a message like "device off-line" (technically this is complete nonsense. Your router should route fine between 2.4GHz and 5GHz but still it is more prone to issues, than with both units on the same frequency.)</p>
        <p><H2>On your head unit</H2>
            <OL>
                <li>If you did not already downloaded my Joying Extra Tools apk, you should now download it from the <a href="https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/releases" target="rooting">Releases</a> page onto your head unit.<br>When you start the apk you will see the following screen:<br><br>
                <img src="images/not_rooted.jpg" width="800"><br><br>
                Your unit is not fully rooted. You already knew this otherwise you would not try to root it. Simply press OK.<br><br></li>
                <li>Next you will see:<br>
                <img src="images/mainscreen_not_rooted.jpg" width="800"><br>
                On Android 6.0.1 and Android 8.0.0, adb over wifi is by default disabled. To root your unit you need to have adb over Wifi enabled.
                Use the button "Enable/Disable adb over WiFi".<br>
                You will get a popup with a short text and a line with "The current setting is:". If it is enabled, you don't have to do anything.</li>
                <li>Now you need to know the ip-address of your head unit. Tap the top-left menu button <img src="images/top-left-icon.jpg" HEIGHT="30%">&nbsp; and select the option "My WiFi address".<br>You need the ip-address for the script on your laptop/pc.<br>You will see something like this:<br><img src="images/WiFiSettings.jpg" width="800"></li>

                    <li>Download the Superuser install script from the <a href="https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/releases/tag/20180107">Releases</a> page onto your pc/laptop. It's called <strong>Superuser-Sofia3GR-Intel.zip</strong>.<br><strong>If you have SuperSU (still) installed, you need to flash your unit first with a Joying firmware ROM to have a "clean" base of install.</strong> Note that this is only necessary if you want to use Xposed.</li>
                    <li>Reboot your unit before you start! My experience is that the adb daemon and/or tcpip stack is not so stable after multiple sleep/wake cycles.</li>
                    <li>Unzip the Superuser-Sofia3GR-Intel.zip somewhere on your pc/laptop.</li>
